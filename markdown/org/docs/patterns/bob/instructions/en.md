title: "Bob the Bib: Sewing Instructions"

<Note>

#### Before we start: One layer or two?

First thing you need to figure out is whether you're going to make a 1-layer (simple) bib,
or do you want to make one out of two layers.

A two-layer bib gives you more options, as you can use an absorbent backing layer like
terrycloth, yet still have the entire cotton selection of your local fabric store available
as your choice for the front layer, aka the visible one.

</Note>
 
## Step 1: Optional: Join layers

If you decide to go for two layers, simply join them together at the edges before applying
the bias tape.

You probably want to pin or bast this prior to sewing. The two different types of fabric
will behave differently, so secure them in place prior to sewing the together.

Make sure to sew close to the edge so that the stitches will be under the bias tape
finish later.


## Step 2: Apply bias tape

Wer're going to apply bias tape as a finish around the entire edge of the bib.

You probably want to start at the bottom strap, as this way the joint of the bias
seam will be covered when the bib is worn.

Just work your way around, and take your time.

### How to sew bias tape

<Note>

#### Single or double fold
Two types of bias tape are commonly available, single fold and double fold.

**Single fold** is most commonly used for facing curved edges on the wrong side of garments. Confusingly, single fold bias tape has two folds, with both long sides folded inwards and the "back" flat, with a small gap left between the edges. You will be able to see the raw edges without needing to spread open the tape. 

**Double fold** bias tape has three folds. The edges are folded inwards, as with single fold bias tape, but then the tape is folded down the midline, turning the raw edges in so they aren't visible unless the tape is spread open. Double fold is most commonly used for binding edges, and is what we will use to sew Bob. To bind edges it is sewn twice, once on the wrong/back side of the garment, and then once on the front.

#### Orient your bias tape
Double fold bias tape may look symmetrical on first inspection, but it will have one side on which the outside fold is slightly lower than on the other side. Without opening the bias tape up, lay it flat on one side, then the other. On one side, you should only see the side facing you, without being able to see the reverse side at all. This is the front side of the bias tape. On the other side, you should be able to see the side facing you, plus a little bit of the other side poking out past the bottom. This is the back of the bias tape. If you're struggling to tell the difference, which is sometimes quite subtle, flip the bias tape so that the outside folds are facing away from you.

If desired, unfold the centre seam of the bias tape and make a small chalk mark on the inside fold of the back of the bias tape. This can make it easier to remember which side is which when basting. The chalk mark will not be visible when the bias tape is fully installed.

#### Finish the end
We can finish the end of the bias tape now, so no raw edges will show where the ends overlap. Take one end of the bias tape and unfold it completely, with the wrong side (inside) facing up. Trim the corners diagonally by a few milimetres. Fold the end over, and stitch into place.

#### Baste the back side
To begin, we will sew the back of the bias tape to the back of the garment. On Bob the Bib, this will be the terrycloth side, if making a double-layer bib.

Starting with the end of the bias tape that we just finished, place the bias tape on the back of the garment, approximately where you wish the join in the ends of the bias tape to be, with the front of the bias tape facing up. Unfold the centre seam by folding the front of the bias tape to the left. You should now have two folds remaining, one of the left and one on the right of the bias tape. Unfold the one on the right, so that side of the bias tape is flattened, with the right side of the bias tape fabric facing towards your garment. We will be sewing it to the garment like this. If desired to make the bias tape easier to wrangle, you can lightly press the centre and back folds open, but do not iron them; we'll need these folds later!

Now align the rightmost edge of the unfolded bias tape to the edge of your garment. At this point, you can either baste the first few centimetres in place and freehand the rest, if confident in your abilities to keep the edge of the tape aligned with the edge of the fabric, or you can baste all the way around. Basting all the way around will likely be easier to manage, especially if you haven't used bias tape before.

If you baste all the way around, make sure the edge of the bias tape remains aligned to the edge of the fabric, gently stretching the bias tape if necessary to conform to corners. If sewing a double layer Bob, make sure that you catch both layers of fabric while basting.

Just before the end, where the bias tape will overlap, hold the bias tape over the edge of the garment to see how much bias tape you will need to complete the edge and leave an overlap of around 1 centimetre (3/8"). Cut the bias tape at this point, then diagonally trim the corners of the trimmed end, taking a few milimetres off. Finish basting down, overlapping the ends and ensuring the folds are aligned.


#### Sew the back side
With all of your edges aligned, begin to sew with the bias tape folded open. Sew close to the rightmost fold of the bias tape, to the right of the fold. As long as you sew just to the right of the fold, these stitches will be hidden when the bias tape is completely installed. Avoid sewing on the left of the fold, as doing so will cause these stitches to be visible on the front side when finished. 

If freehanding without having fully basted the edge, be extra careful to ensure that the edges stay aligned, especially on a double layer Bob, and that your stitches are catching all layers of fabric. Missing any layers of fabric can cause the final garment to gape at the edges and fall apart. Just before the end, where the bias tape will overlap, hold the bias tape over the edge of the garment to see how much bias tape you will need to complete the edge and leave an overlap of around 1 centimetre (3/8"). Cut the bias tape at this point, then diagonally trim the corners of the trimmed end, taking a few milimetres off. Finish sewing, overlapping the ends and ensuring the folds are aligned.

You should now have an edge with the bias tape sewn to one side, and the centre fold of the bias tape unfolded inwards towards the middle of the garment.

#### Sew the front
Refold the rightmost fold of the bias tape, flipping the rest of the bias tape outwards, and turn your garment right side up. The original centre fold of the bias tape should now be encasing the raw edge of your fabric, with the front side of the bias tape unsewn and resting against the front of your garment. The front fold of the bias tape should be folded in, so no raw edges of the bias tape are showing. If desired, you can baste down the front side of the bias tape, but it generally behaves well enough without this, since it's held in place by the stitches on the back.

Begin to topstitch the bias tape, starting 1-2 cm past where the ends overlap. The overlap will be stitched last. Stitch close to the inside (away from the edge of the garment), ideally leaving a 2-3 mm space between the stitching and the folded edge of the bias tape. As you do so, this should cover up the stitches visible from where we attached the back of the bias tape.

Avoid "rolling" the bias tape forwards as you work; the centre fold of the bias tape should remain centred on the edge of the fabric, not pulled to the front. This is especially critical (and difficult) on corners. If the bias tape is rolled forwards, the topstitching will overshoot the back side of the bias tape and be visible on the garment fabric.

As you approach the overlapping ends of the tape, ensure that the end with raw edges is neatly tucked inside the end with the edge that we finished, front and back. Finish sewing.

## Step 3: Install snaps or button

Next, install the snaps on the straps, as indicated on the pattern. 

If you don't have or want snaps, you can also use a button + buttonhole.


## Step 4: You're done!

That was easy ðŸ˜ƒ
